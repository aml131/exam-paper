![Ninja Slice game ScreenShot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/448fc0f6-fe4f-4a07-a9dd-6d63ebe489d1)
## Introduction
I made this game as a project of the Software Engineering bootcamp in General Assembly. I was asked to make a game using HTML, JavaScript AND CSS.
My game is inspired by Fruit Ninja. Basically it has papers falling from the top, and the player has to collect them. Missing three papers leads u to lose the game + Collecting 5 papers makes u win it.
## Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Canvas
- Git
- Canva (to design the background)
- Pixilart (to paint images)
## Game Features
- Simple UI
- Sounds for every scenario
- Counter for score + misses
- Start page
## Code Overview
The game was made using canvas for smoother animation. And JavaScript functions to control the game loop, the winning and losing scenarios, spwan falling exam papers .the main logic includes tracking score and misses, drawing on the canvas, and resetting the game with a restart button.
On the start page i added two buttons. "how to play" and "start game"
## Things ill add if i had time
- Papers getting actually sliced
- every exam paper adds different amount of score
- F exam paper makes u lose
